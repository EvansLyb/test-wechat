Show us with a sequence diagram or bullet points with detail steps.

## What We Care About

Feel free to use any libraries you would use if this were a real production App, but remember we're interested in your code & the way you solve the problem, not how well you can use a particular library.

We're interested in your method and how you approach the problem just as much as we're interested in the end result.

Here's what you should aim for:

- Good use of current Wechat mini-program official guide.
- Solid testing approach.
- Extensible code.

## Q&A

> Where should I send back the result when I'm done?

Fork this repo and send us a pull request when you think you are done. We don't have a deadline for the task.

> What if I have a question?

Create a new issue in the repo and we will get back to you very quickly.
